		<p><strong>Fun facts about Koala&rsquo;s</strong></p>

<p><em>&bull; The biggest problem for Koalas is that their bushland (or &quot;habitat&quot;) is being cut down to make way for houses.</em></p>

<p><em>&bull; Koalas have two thumbs on their front paws - to help them climb, to hold onto the tree and to grip their food.</em></p>

<p><em>&bull; Koalas are mostly NOCTURNAL animals. This means that they sleep in the daytime, and move around and feed at night.</em></p>

<p><em>&bull; An adult koala eats about 1/2 - 1 kilogram of leaves each night.</em></p>

<p><em>&bull; Koalas&#39; fur is different in different parts of Australia. In the southern parts of Australia it is longer and shaggier than in the north, in order to keep them warm in the cold southern winters.</em></p>
